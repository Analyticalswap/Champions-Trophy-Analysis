# Champions-Trophy-Analysis
This is a real time dashboard where i put daily match data into source manually so it reflect direct to dashboardfor real time stats.

Calculations:
1.	Team Win Rate:
=Total Wins / total_Matches *100
=D2/C2*100

2.	Bowler Economy Rate:
Economy Rate = Total Runs Conducted / Total Overs Bowled
E.g  E.R= 58 Runs / 9.5 Overs = 6.11

3.	Batsmen Strike Rate:
Batting Strike Rate = (Total Runs Scored / Total Balls Faced) * 100.

4.	Batsman Batting Average:
Batting Average = (Total Runs Scored) / (Number of Dismissals)
No of dismissal means batman is out, if batsman is not out then its not count in dismissal.
